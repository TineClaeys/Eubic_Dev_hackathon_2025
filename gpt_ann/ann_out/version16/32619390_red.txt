Shotgun proteomics analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and how it can optimize whole viral particle antigen production for vaccines. 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and is continuing to spread rapidly around the globe. No effective vaccine is currently available to prevent COVID-19, and intense efforts are being invested worldwide into vaccine development. In this context, all technology platforms must overcome several challenges resulting from the use of an incompletely characterized new virus. These include finding the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles. Here, we describe a shotgun tandem mass spectrometry workflow, the data produced can be used to guide optimization of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the changes occurring in the host cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection to glean information on the biological processes modulated by the virus that could be further explored as potential drug targets to deal with the pandemic.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and virus preparation
Vero E6 (ATCC, CLR-1586) cells were cultured at 37degreesC under 9% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco(TM), ThermoFisher) supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were passaged following trypsinization every 2 days. The SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1 (Genbank MT066156) was provided by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Rome, Italy) via the EVAg network (European Virus Archive goes global). The stock SARS-CoV-2 used in the experiments described here had undergone two passages on Vero E6 cells and was stored at -80degreesC. Virus titre was determined by standard plaque assay (1 x 107 pfu/ml).
Infection
To determine the kinetics of infection, 1 x 106 Vero cells seeded in 25 cm2 flasks were grown to confluence in 5 mL DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin overnight at 37degreesC under 9% CO2. Cells were infected at two multiplicities of infection (MOI; 0.01 and 0.001) and harvested at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days post-infection (dpi). Supernatants from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were recovered for plaque assay titration to confirm the production of infectious viral particles. Infected Vero cells were observed under a microscope to determine cytopathic effect at the same time-points.
Quantification of viral RNA by RT-qPCR
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture supernatant samples, and supernatant plus cells was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus Mini kit (Macherey Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit is designed to recover viral RNA from cell-free fluids. RNA was analysed by RT-qPCR using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System Thermal Cycler (BioRad). Primers targeting IP2 and IP4 (RdRp), used at 0.4 microM per reaction, were as recommended: nCoV_IP2-12669Fw (ATGAGCTTAGTCCTGTTG) nCoV_IP2-12759Rv (CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT) nCoV_IP2-12696bProbe(+) (AGATGTCTTGTGCTGCCGGTA [5']Hex [3']BHQ-1) and nCoV_IP4-14059Fw (GGTAACTGGTATGATTTCG) nCoV_IP4-14146Rv (CTGGTCAAGGTTAATATAGG) nCoV_IP4-14084Probe(+) (TCATACAAACCACGCCAGG [5']Fam [3']BHQ-1), respectively. Standard curves were created using in vitro-transcribed RNA derived from the BetaCoV_Wuhan_WIV04_2019 strain (EPI_ISL_402124). The transcript contains the amplification regions of the RdRp and E gene as positive strand. Microtubes were prepared with 1011 copies of target sequences diluted in yeast tRNAs (to facilitate recovery), and lyophilized. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for each group (n = 3).
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry
At several time-points, SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS to remove cell culture medium and FCS. Cells were recovered in 1.5 ml of PBS. The virus was inactivated and the cells lysed by autoclaving the samples at 125degreesC for 40 min. Proteins were precipitated by adding cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). After 5 min at 4degreesC, the precipitated material was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min. The proteins in the resulting pellets were dissolved in 100 muL LDS 1X (Lithium dodecyl sulfate) sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol (vol/vol). Samples were sonicated with a Hielscher UP50H disruptor for 20 s operating at 60% amplitude, alternating 0.25-s impulsions with incubation for 5 min at 99degreesC. A 20-microl aliquot of a 1/8 dilution in LDS 1X (Invitrogen) of each sample was loaded on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel and subjected to short (5-min) SDS-PAGE migration. Proteins were stained for 5 min with Coomassie SimplyBlue SafeStain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to in-gel trypsin proteolysis, as described in Hartmann et al..
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
Peptides were identified using an ultimate 3000 nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were first desalted on a reverse-phase PepMap 100 C18 mu-precolumn (5 mum, 100 Aa, 300 mum i.d. x 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) before separation on a nanoscale PepMap 100 C18 nano-LC column (3 mum, 100 Aa, 75 mum i.d. x 50 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by applying a 120 min gradient (100 min from 4% to 25% solvent B, and 20 min from 25% to 40% of solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.2 muL per min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, solvent B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water. The mass spectrometer was operated in Top20 mode. Full MS were acquired from 350 to 1500 m/z and the 20 most abundant precursor ions were selected for fragmentation, applying a 10-s dynamic exclusion window. Ions with charge 2+ and 3+ were selected for MS/MS analysis. Secondary ions were isolated within a 2.0-m/z window.
MS/MS data interpretation and label-free protein quantification
The MS/MS spectra recorded for each sample were assigned to peptide sequences using the MASCOT Server 2.5.1 (Matrix Science). Contaminant spectra were first removed by searching against an in-house "common contaminants" database (384 sequences; 187,250 residues) including 361 contaminants classically observed in proteomics (cRAP + additional contaminants) and 23 Bos taurus sequences corresponding to the most abundant proteins from FCS, present in the cell culture medium. The remaining sequences were searched against a database (20,585 sequences; 10,847,418 residues) containing the UniProt Chlorocebus sequences (downloaded March 2020) and the Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. The following parameters were used in peptide-to-MS/MS spectrum assignment: full trypsin specificity, maximum of two missed cleavages, mass tolerances on the parent ion of 5 ppm and 0.02 Da on the MS/MS, static modifications were carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57.0215) and oxidized methionine (+15.9949), whereas the dynamic modifications allowed were deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.984016). MASCOT DAT files were parsed using the Python version of Matrix Science msparser, version 2.5.1, with the ms_peptidesummary function. Peptide-to-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) with expectation values corresponding to a 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR) were validated using MASCOT's homology threshold option. Multiple PSMs were allowed for MS/MS spectra if ion scores were higher than 98% of the top ion score. Proteins were grouped if they shared at least one peptide, and label-free quantification of each group was based on PSM counts for each protein following the principle of parsimony. Proteins identified by one or more specific peptides were retained for the analysis (protein FDR 1%).
MS/MS data repository.
Mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository under dataset identifier PXD018594 and 10.6019/PXD018594.
Data analysis
Principal component analysis was performed as previously described. Co-expression cluster analysis was performed using the Bioconductor R package coseq v1.5.2. The protein abundance matrix was used as input in coseqR. Log CLR-transformation was applied to the matrix to normalize the protein abundance profiles and the K-means algorithm was chosen to detect clusters that were co-expressed across the different time-points. The K-mean algorithm was repeated 20 times to determine the optimal number of clusters. The resulting number of clusters in each run was recorded, and the most parsimonious cluster partition was selected using the slope heuristics approach. Both the principal component analysis (PCA) and the coseq analysis were performed after removal of proteins with spectral counts of less than three (1402 host protein groups retained). Finally, proteins assigned to the different clusters were retained for cluster visualization and gene ontology (GO)-enrichment analysis for each cluster. Statistically enriched (FDR <= 0.05) GO terms on proteins that are differentially expressed between pairwise samples or on proteins assigned to each co-expression cluster were identified using Metascape. The statistically most enriched GO terms were visualized in ggplot2.
