T1	Organism	1704	1710	human	Explicit	...from patients with BCa. This biobank currently includes tissue and/or urine samples from approximately 170 patients. The diagnosis of the patients was based on histological evaluation of the tissues obtained by surgical procedure...
T2	Disease	1652	1656	BCa	Explicit	...for early detection, particularly for low-grade and low-stage BCa as well as for risk stratification. By using an in-solution digestion method and label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS coupled with ion mobility, we profiled the BCa tissues...
T3	Instrument	4357	4400	SYNAPT G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometer	Explicit	...using ACQUITY UPLC(R) M-Class (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) coupled with SYNAPT G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Data were obtained using ion-mobility separation...
T4	AcquisitionMethod	4510	4514	DIA	Explicit	...label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS, a total of 18 tissue samples were profiled, grouped into 3 groups of 6 samples each: (1) Group 1 (Ta, G1), (2) Group 2 (T1, G2-G3) and (3) Group 3 (T2-T3, G3). Patients were aged 39-82 years with no significant...
T5	NumberOfSamples	4408	4410	18	Explicit	...proteomics analysis by label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS, a total of 18 tissue samples were profiled, grouped into 3 groups of 6 samples each: (1) Group 1 (Ta, G1), (2) Group 2 (T1, G2-G3) and (3) Group 3 (T2-T3, G3). Patients were aged 39-82 years...
T6	Age	4852	4854	39	Explicit	...Patients were aged 39-82 years with no significant differences among groups regarding age (Table 3, Supplementary Table S3). The selected potential biomarkers from the comparative tissue proteomics analysis were tested in urine samples from BCa patients...
T7	Age	4855	4857	82	Explicit	...Patients were aged 39-82 years with no significant differences among groups regarding age (Table 3, Supplementary Table S3). The selected potential biomarkers from the comparative tissue proteomics analysis were tested in urine samples from BCa patients...
T8	SampleTreatment	5236	5276	Protein extraction from the fresh frozen tissues	Explicit	...Protein extraction from the fresh frozen tissues (10-15 mg per sample) was pulverized with liquid nitrogen. Tissue powder was dispersed in Lysis buffer (4% SDS, 5 mM MgCl2x6H2O, 10 mM CHAPS, 100 mM NH4HCO3, 50 mM DTT) in a 1:20 ratio (w/v), mixed and allowed...
T9	CleavageAgent	6038	6045	trypsin	Explicit	...Digestion was performed at 30 degreesC overnight at 1:20 (w/w) enzyme-to-substrate ratio using sequencing-grade-modified trypsin. Enzymatic digestion was quenched by addition of 0.5% formic acid (FA). SDC under acidic conditions was pelleted by centrifugation...
T10	Modification	6503	6523	Carbamidomethylation of cysteine	Explicit	...Trypsin with non-specific cleavage on both ends of the peptide was allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was considered as fixed modification. The PEAKS PTM algorithm was used to identify the presence of uDPMs in the brain proteomes...
T11	TumorGrade	3221	3228	Grade 3	Inferred	...The biobank contains tissue and urine samples from all stages of BCa with tumor sizes from Ta to T3, classified into Grade 1 (n = 33), Grade 2 (n = 78), and Grade 3 (n = 61). The study was designed to investigate proteomics alterations...
T12	TumorStage	3285	3287	T2	Inferred	...The study was designed to investigate proteomics alterations in BCa progression starting from low-grade (G1) Ta tumors to high-grade (G2-G3) T1-T2 tumors. For the comparative proteomics analysis by label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS, a total of...
T13	Treatment	6212	6245	RapiGest	Predicted	...Samples were prepared for LC-MS/MS using RapiGest as previously described in detail...
