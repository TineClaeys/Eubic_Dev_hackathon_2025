Title: 
Proteomic Atlas of the Human Brain in Alzheimer's Disease. 
Abstract:
The brain represents one of the most divergent and critical organs in the human body. Yet, it can be afflicted by a variety of neurodegenerative diseases specifically linked to aging, about which we lack a full biomolecular understanding of onset and progression, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we provide a proteomic resource comprising nine anatomically distinct sections from three aged individuals, across a spectrum of disease progression, categorized by quantity of neurofibrillary tangles. Using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, we identify a core brain proteome that exhibits only small variance in expression, accompanied by a group of proteins that are highly differentially expressed in individual sections and broader regions. AD affected tissue exhibited slightly elevated levels of tau protein with similar relative expression to factors associated with the AD pathology. Substantial differences were identified between previous proteomic studies of mature adult brains and our aged cohort. Our findings suggest considerable value in examining specifically the brain proteome of aged human populations from a multiregional perspective. This resource can serve as a guide, as well as a point of reference for how specific regions of the brain are affected by aging and neurodegeneration.
Materials & Methods: 
Tissue Extraction.
Individual brains were extracted and rapidly flash frozen with a maximum post-mortem interval of five hours for the atlas and fifteen hours for the secondary cohort. (Supplemental Table 1). Brains were stored in -80degrees C freezers, taken out and given to the clinical neuropathologist to collect precise brain samples, which averaged about 1g. After collection they were immediately put on dry ice and sent to the proteomics lab.
Tissue Staining.
Slices were taken from anterior hippocampal region and sectioned using a microtome. Sections were warmed to incubation temperature before being stained with alpha-phosphorylated tau protein antibody for 15 mins. Tissue sections were then stained with hematoxylin before being imaged.
Extraction and Digestion.
Each tissue sample was suspended in 1.2 ml lysis buffer (6M Guanadine HCl, 100mM Tris pH 8) before being probe sonicated (Misonix XL-2000) to lyse the cells. After sonication a protein BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was performed to determine protein concentrations of the lysate. Sample lysates ranged in concentration from approximately 6-13 mg/ml. 500ug of protein was aliquoted from each sample lysate. Each aliquot was brought up to 90% methanol before being centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5 min. Supernate was disposed and the precipitate was resuspended in 240ul of reducing and alkylating buffer (8M urea, 10mM TCEP, 40mM CAA, 100mM Tris pH 8). The sample solution was then diluted to 25% concentration with 100mM Tris, pH 8. Trypsin was added to the protein lysate sample at a ratio of 50:1 w/v and digested overnight. Digested samples were desalted using Strata-X Polymeric Reverse Phase column (Phenomenex). Samples were then dried in SpeedVac Concentrator.
Fractionation
Dried samples were resuspended in 0.2% formic acid before fractionation using an HPLC (Agilent, Infinity 2000) with a C18 reverse-phase column (Waters, XBridge Peptide BEH, particle size 3.5um). Mobile phase buffer A was a fresh-made mixture of 10mM ammonium acetate, pH 10, while mobile phase buffer B was composed of 10mM ammonium acetate, 80% methanol, pH 10. Each sample was separated into 32 fractions. Fractions were collected directly in a round-bottom 96-well plates, allowing three samples to be contained in each plate. Fractions were concatenated by combing fractions 1-8 with 18-25 and combining fractions 9 -17 with 26-32, to yield 16 fractions. In the interest of time fraction number was again reduced to 12 by pooling 15 & 16, 13 & 14, 1 & 2, and 3 & 4. Plates were dried down in the SpeedVac Concentrator. Samples were resuspended in 0.2% formic acid for instrument injection
LC-MS/MS
Online reverse-phase columns were prepared in house. A laser puller was used to generate tips on ~35cm long silica columns with an inner diameter of 75um and an outer diameter of 360um. Columns were filled with 1.7um, 130 Aa pore size, Bridged Ethylene Hybrid C18 particles. Column was heated and maintained at a temperature of 50degreesC and connected to instrument by an embedded emitter. A Waters UHPLC was used for online chromatography with mobile phase buffer A consisting of 0.2% formic acid and mobile phase buffer B consisting of 0.2% formic acid with 70% acetonitrile. Fractionated Samples were loaded onto the column for 12 min at a flow rate of 0.35 ul/minute. Mobile phase B increased to 4% in the first min then increased on a gradient to 55% B at 75 minutes. The method increased percent B to 100% by 76 minutes. Method ended with 3 min wash at 100% B and 10 min wash at 0% B.
Single shot samples were analyzed using 120 min LC method where Samples were loaded onto the column for 7 min at a flow rate of 0.33 ul/minute. Mobile phase B increased to 7% in the first 6 min then increased on a gradient to 50% B at 104 minutes. The method increased percent B to 100% by 105 minutes. Method ended with 5 min wash at 100% B and 10 min wash at 0% B.
Eluting peptide fragments were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Survey scans of precursors were taken from 300 to 1350 m/z at 240,000 resolution while using Advanced Precursor Determination. Tandem MS was performed using an isolation window of 0.7 Th with a 25ppm mass tolerance and a dynamic exclusion time of 20s. Selected precursors were fragmented using a normalized collision energy level of 30. MS2 ion count target was set at 2 x 104 ions with a maximum injection time of 18 miliseconds. Scans were taken at the rapid speed setting and only peptides with a charge state of +2 or greater were selected for fragmentation.
Data Searching & Analysis
All raw files from the fractionated samples were searched together in the software MaxQuant(version 1.5.2.8) with each sample input as an experiment made up of 12 fractions. Spectra were searched using fast LFQ against a full human proteome with isoforms downloaded from Uniprot (June 14, 2017). Carbamidomethyl was set as a fixed modification. Matching between runs was used with a retention time window of 0.7 mins. Searches were performed using a protein FDR of 1%, a minimum peptide length of 7, and 0.5 Da MS2 match tolerance. Protein data was then extracted from the "ProteinGroups.txt" file of the Maxquant output after decoy, contaminants, and reverse sequences were removed. All single shot samples were searched together using the same parameters, with the only difference being the use of a more recent human proteome from Uniprot (November 29, 2018). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/ ) with the dataset identifier PXD010603.
Data imputation and hierarchical clustering were performed using an in-house data development tool(coonlabdatadev.com). Imputation was performed for proteins observed in at least 50% of the samples from each section, by replacing missing values with values selected from the lowest 3% of the distribution of log transformed intensities. Boxplots were generated using R and Boxplotr. Pearson correlations were performed in R. To ensure we were not altering trends with imputation the Pearson analyses was also performed using only proteins observed in all samples and the results were indistinguishable from the confidently imputed dataset. Gene ontology enrichment was performed using the National Cancer Institute Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).
