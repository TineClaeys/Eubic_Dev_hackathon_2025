Elucidating the RNA-Protein Interactomes of Target RNAs in Tissue. 
RNA-protein interactions are key to many aspects of cellular homeostasis and their identification is important to understanding cellular function. Multiple strategies have been developed for the RNA-centric characterization of RNA-protein complexes. However, these studies have all been done in immortalized cell lines that do not capture the complexity of heterogeneous tissue samples. Here, we develop hybridization purification of RNA-protein complexes followed by mass spectrometry (HyPR-MS) for use in tissue samples. We isolated both polyadenylated RNA and the specific long noncoding RNA MALAT1 and characterized their protein interactomes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of HyPR-MS in tissue for the multiplexed characterization of specific RNA-protein complexes.
