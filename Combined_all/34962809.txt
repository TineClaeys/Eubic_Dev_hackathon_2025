Organ-Based Proteome and Post-Translational Modification Profiling of a Widely Cultivated Tropical Water Fish, Labeo rohita. 
Proteomics has enormous applications in human and animal research. However, proteomic studies in fisheries science are quite scanty particularly for economically important species. Few proteomic studies have been carried out in model fish species, but comprehensive proteomics of aquaculture species are still scarce. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive organ-based protein profiling of important tissue samples for one of the most important aquaculture species,Labeo rohita.Deep proteomic profiling of 17 histologically normal tissues, blood plasma, and embryo provided mass-spectrometric evidence for 8498 proteins at 1% false discovery rate that make up about 26% of the total annotated protein-coding sequences in Rohu. Tissue-wise expression analysis was performed, and the presence of several biologically important proteins was also verified using a targeted proteomic approach. We identified the global post-translational modifications (PTMs) in terms of acetylation (N-terminus and lysine), methylation (N-terminus, lysine, and arginine), and phosphorylation (serine, threonine, and tyrosine) to present a comprehensive proteome resource. An interactive web-based portal has been developed for an overall landscape of protein expression across the studied tissues of Labeo rohita (www.fishprot.org). This draft proteome map of Labeo rohita would advance basic and applied research in aquaculture to meet the most critical challenge of providing food and nutritional security to an increasing world population.
