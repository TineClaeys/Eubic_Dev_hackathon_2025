Observations from the Proteomics Bench. 
Many challenges in proteomics result from the high-throughput nature of the experiments. This paper first presents pre-analytical problems, which still occur, although the call for standardization in omics has been ongoing for many years. This article also discusses aspects that affect bioinformatic analysis based on three sets of reference data measured with different orbitrap instruments. Despite continuous advances in mass spectrometer technology as well as analysis software, data-set-wise quality control is still necessary, and decoy-based estimation, although challenged by modern instruments, should be utilized. We draw attention to the fact that numerous young researchers perceive proteomics as a mature, readily applicable technology. However, it is important to emphasize that the maximum potential of the technology can only be realized by an educated handling of its limitations.
