Development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of Fusobacterium necrophorum antibody in animal sera. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of Fusobacterium necrophorum antibody in the sera of rabbits, cattle, and sheep were developed, using a ribosome-rich extract (RRE) from F necrophorum as the antigen. Test character, including optimal antigen dilution and substrate incubation periods, was established, using rabbit, bovine, and ovine antisera produced against RRE from isolates of F necrophorum. Rabbit antisera produced against 7 other species of bacteria were used to test the specificity of the F necrophorum RRE antigen. Cross-reactivity was not detected. Sera from 50 feedlot cattle were examined with the bovine ELISA. Of the 50 samples, 43 (88%) were positive for F necrophorum antibody. The ELISA developed in this study were sensitive and specific and appear to be readily adaptable to serologic investigations of F necrophorum.
