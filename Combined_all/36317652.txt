Deep Phosphoproteome Landscape of Interhemispheric Functionality of Neuroanatomical Regions of the Human Brain. 
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are one of the compulsive and predominant biological processes that regulate the diverse molecular mechanism, modulate the onset of disease, and are the reason behind the functional diversity of proteins. Despite the widespread research findings in neuroproteomics, one of the key drawbacks has been the lack of proteome-level knowledge of hemispheric lateralization. We have investigated the proteome level expression in different neuroanatomical regions under the Human Brain Proteome Project (HBPP) and developed the global interhemispheric brain proteome map (Brainprot) earlier. Furthermore, this study has extended to decipher the phosphoproteome map of human brain interhemispheric regions through high-resolution mass spectrometry. The phosphoproteomics examination of 12 unique interhemispheric neurological brain regions using Orbitrap fusion liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry provided comprehensive coverage of 996 phosphoproteins, 2010 phosphopeptides, and 3567 phosphosites. Moreover, interhemispheric phosphoproteome profiling has been categorized according to synaptic ontologies and interhemispheric expression to understand the functionality. Finally, we have integrated the phosphosites data under the PhosphoMap section in the Inter-Hemispheric Brain Proteome Map Portal (https://www.brainprot.org/) for the advancement and support of the ongoing neuroproteomics research worldwide. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD031188.
