Digging More Missing Proteins Using an Enrichment Approach with ProteoMiner. 
Human Proteome Project (HPP) aims at mapping entire human proteins with a systematic effort upon all the emerging techniques, which would enhance understanding of human biology and lay a foundation for development of medical applications. Until now, 2563 missing proteins (MPs, PE2-4) are still undetected even using the most sensitive approach of protein detection. Herein, we propose that enrichment of low-abundance proteins benefits MPs finding. ProteoMiner is an equalizing technique by reducing high-abundance proteins and enriching low-abundance proteins in biological liquids. With triton X-100/TBS buffer extraction, ProteoMiner enrichment, and peptide fractionation, 20 MPs (at least two non-nested unique peptides with more than eight a.a. length) with 60 unique peptides were identified from four human tissues including eight membrane/secreted proteins and five nucleus proteins. Then 15 of them were confirmed with two non-nested unique peptides (>=9 a.a.) identified by matching well with their chemically synthetic peptides in PRM assay. Hence, these results demonstrated ProteoMiner as a powerful means in discovery of MPs.
