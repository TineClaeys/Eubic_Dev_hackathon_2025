mRNA decapping activators Pat1 and Dhh1 regulate transcript abundance and translation to tune cellular responses to nutrient availability. 
We have examined the roles of yeast mRNA decapping-activators Pat1 and Dhh1 in repressing the translation and abundance of specific mRNAs in nutrient-replete cells using ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, CAGE analysis of capped mRNAs, RNA Polymerase II ChIP-Seq, and TMT-mass spectrometry of mutants lacking one or both factors. Although the Environmental Stress Response (ESR) is activated in dhh1Delta and pat1Delta mutants, hundreds of non-ESR transcripts are elevated in a manner indicating cumulative repression by Pat1 and Dhh1 in wild-type cells. These mRNAs show both reduced decapping and diminished transcription in the mutants, indicating that impaired mRNA turnover drives transcript derepression in cells lacking Dhh1 or Pat1. mRNA degradation stimulated by Dhh1/Pat1 is not dictated by poor translation nor enrichment for suboptimal codons. Pat1 and Dhh1 also collaborate to reduce translation and protein production from many mRNAs. Transcripts showing concerted translational repression by Pat1/Dhh1 include mRNAs involved in cell adhesion or utilization of the poor nitrogen source allantoin. Pat1/Dhh1 also repress numerous transcripts involved in respiration, catabolism of non-preferred carbon or nitrogen sources, or autophagy; and we obtained evidence for elevated respiration and autophagy in the mutants. Thus, Pat1 and Dhh1 function as post-transcriptional repressors of multiple pathways normally activated only during nutrient limitation.
