Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals the Importance of CK2, MAPKs and CDPKs in Response to Phosphate Starvation in Rice. 
Phosphorus is one of the most important macronutrients required for plant growth and development. The importance of phosphorylation modification in regulating phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants is emerging. We performed phosphoproteomic profiling to characterize proteins whose degree of phosphorylation is altered in response to Pi starvation in rice root. A subset of 554 proteins, including 546 down-phosphorylated and eight up-phosphorylated proteins, exhibited differential phosphorylation in response to Pi starvation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis with the differentially phosphorylated proteins indicated that RNA processing, transport, splicing and translation and carbon metabolism played critical roles in response to Pi starvation in rice. Levels of phosphorylation of four mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including OsMAPK6, five calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and OsCK2beta3 decreased in response to Pi starvation. The decreased phosphorylation level of OsMAPK6 was confirmed by Western blotting. Mutation of OsMAPK6 led to Pi accumulation under Pi-sufficient conditions. Motif analysis indicated that the putative MAPK, casein kinase 2 (CK2) and CDPK substrates represented about 54.4%, 21.5% and 4.7%, respectively, of the proteins exhibiting differential phosphorylation. Based on the motif analysis, 191, 151 and 46 candidate substrates for MAPK, CK2 and CDPK were identified. These results indicate that modification of phosphorylation profiles provides complementary information on Pi-starvation-induced processes, with CK2, MAPK and CDPK protein kinase families playing key roles in these processes in rice.
