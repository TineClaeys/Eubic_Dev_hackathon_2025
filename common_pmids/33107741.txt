Proteomic Profiling of the Human Tissue and Biological Fluid Proteome. 
In-depth analysis of the human genome sequence has led to the annotation of approximately 20,000 human protein-coding genes. Although mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflows have made a great headway in achieving near genome-wide coverage, an equivalent complete map of the human proteome remains elusive. Delineating the spatial distribution of all human proteins at the organ, tissue, and cellular level can offer insight into health and disease and represents an excellent reference for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, we performed label-free liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to profile the normal human proteome. In total, we analyzed 117 samples from 46 normal tissues and organs at autopsy. Our high-resolution MS approach allowed for the quantification of 10,438 unique proteins. In order to expand our coverage of the human proteome, we combined our previously published biological fluid proteomic data from healthy individuals. We considered data from seven biological fluids, including urine, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, seminal plasma, sweat, cervical vaginal fluid, and nipple aspirate fluid. Overall, we generated tandem mass spectra corresponding to 13,028 unique human protein-coding genes. Although our analysis did not accomplish complete proteome coverage, it should be an important complementary resource for future biomarker discovery.
