Deciphering the human brain proteome: characterization of the anterior temporal lobe and corpus callosum as part of the Chromosome 15-centric Human Proteome Project. 
Defining the proteomes encoded by each chromosome and characterizing proteins related to human illnesses are among the goals of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) and the Biology and Disease-driven HPP. Following these objectives, we investigated the proteomes of the human anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and corpus callosum (CC) collected post-mortem from eight subjects. Using a label-free GeLC-MS/MS approach, we identified 2454 proteins in the ATL and 1887 in the CC through roughly 7500 and 5500 peptides, respectively. Considering that the ATL is a gray-matter region while the CC is a white-matter region, they presented proteomes specific to their functions. Besides, 38 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between the two regions. Furthermore, the proteome data sets were classified according to their chromosomal origin, and five proteins were evidenced at the MS level for the first time. We identified 70 proteins of the chromosome 15 - one of them for the first time by MS - which were submitted to an in silico pathway analysis. These revealed branch point proteins associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes and dyskeratosis congenita, which are chromosome-15-associated diseases. Data presented here can be a useful for brain disorder studies as well as for contributing to the C-HPP initiative. Our data are publicly available as resource data to C-HPP participant groups at http://yoda.iq.ufrj.br/Daniel/chpp2013. Additionally, the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000547 for the corpus callosum and PXD000548 for the anterior temporal lobe.
