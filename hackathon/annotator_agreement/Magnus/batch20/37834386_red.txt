Proteomics Profiling of Bladder Cancer Tissues from Early to Advanced Stages Reveals NNMT and GALK1 as Biomarkers for Early Detection and Prognosis of BCa. 
The high recurrence rate and invasive diagnostic and monitoring methods in bladder cancer (BCa) clinical management require the development of new non-invasive molecular tools for early detection, particularly for low-grade and low-stage BCa as well as for risk stratification. By using an in-solution digestion method and label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS coupled with ion mobility, we profiled the BCa tissues from initiation to advanced stages and confidently identified and quantified 1619 proteins (>=2 peptides). A statistically significant difference in abundance (Anova <= 0.05) showed 494 proteins. Significant correlation with stage with steady up or down with BCa stages showed 15 proteins. Testing of NNMT, GALK1, and HTRA1 in urine samples showed excellent diagnostic potential for NNMT and GALK1 with AUC of 1.000 (95% CI: 1.000-1.000; p < 0.0001) and 0.801 (95% CI: 0.655-0.947; p < 0.0001), respectively. NNMT and GALK1 also showed very good potential in discriminating non-invasive low-grade from invasive high-grade BCa with AUC of 0.763 (95% CI: 0.606-0.921; p = 0.001) and 0.801 (95% CI: 0.653-0.950; p < 0.0001), respectively. The combination of NNMT and GALK1 increased prognostic accuracy (AUC = 0.813). Our results broaden the range of potential novel candidates for non-invasive BCa diagnosis and prognosis.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Patients Samples
The tissue samples used for the proteomics profiling are part of the RCGEB MASA biobank of snap-frozen tumors from patients with BCa. This biobank currently includes tissue and/or urine samples from approximately 170 patients. The diagnosis of the patients was based on histological evaluation of the tissues obtained by surgical procedure. The biobank contains tissue and urine samples from all stages of BCa with tumor sizes from Ta to T3, classified into Grade 1 (n = 33), Grade 2 (n = 78), and Grade 3 (n = 61). The study was designed to investigate proteomics alterations in BCa progression starting from low-grade (G1) Ta tumors to high-grade (G2-G3) T1-T2 tumors. For the comparative proteomics analysis by label-free data-independent LC-MS/MS, a total of 18 tissue samples were profiled, grouped into 3 groups of 6 samples each: (1) Group 1 (Ta, G1), (2) Group 2 (T1, G2-G3) and (3) Group 3 (T2-T3, G3). Patients were aged 39-82 years with no significant differences among groups regarding age (Table 3, Supplementary Table S3).
The selected potential biomarkers from the comparative tissue proteomics analysis were tested in urine samples from BCa patients and controls. We had two cohorts of urine samples: Cohort I consisted of samples taken during the cystoscopy and frozen immediately at -80 degreesC without any processing; and Cohort II consisted of urine samples collected according to standard guidelines as first-morning urine, that were further centrifuged at 1000x g for 10 min to remove cell debris, aliquoted in 1.5 mL tubes, and stored at -80 degreesC until use. As a first criterion, we preselected the urine samples, excluding samples with hematuria. Although the initial aim was for Cohort I to include urine samples from the same patients that were included in the comparative tissue proteomics analysis, in the end only 5 urine samples were included from these patients, due to the presence of hematuria in the remaining samples. The remaining samples that had no hematuria were from other patients. Currently, the biobank contains a limited number of urine samples collected during the cystoscopy we had only 24 urine samples without hematuria, divided into the following groups: Group 1 (Ta, G1) (n = 9); Group 2 (Ta, G2) (n = 9); Group 3 (T1, G3) (n = 4) and Group 4 (T2, G2-G3) (n = 2). Cohort II consisted of 52 urine samples of which, 8 controls without BCa and 44 BCa samples without hematuria were divided into the following groups: Group 1 (Ta, G1) (n = 16); Group 2 (T1, G2-G3) (n = 13); and Group 3 (T2, G3) (n = 15). There were no significant differences among groups regarding age in both urine cohorts (Table 3, Supplementary Table S3).
4.2. Sample Preparation
Protein extraction from the fresh frozen tissues (10-15 mg per sample) was pulverized with liquid nitrogen. Tissue powder was dispersed in Lysis buffer (4% SDS, 5 mM MgCl2x6H2O, 10 mM CHAPS, 100 mM NH4HCO3, 50 mM DTT) in a 1:20 ratio (w/v), mixed and allowed to dissolve by sonication in an ice bath for 30 min. If the samples were viscous, Lysis buffer was added to max. 10% of the starting volume and the samples were vortexed and sonicated again. The protein content was quantified by the Bradford method. Samples were prepared for LC-MS/MS using RapiGest as previously described in detail.
4.3. LC-MS/MS Data Acquisition
A label-free LC-MS/MS protein profiling was performed using ACQUITY UPLC(R) M-Class (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) coupled with SYNAPT G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Data were obtained using ion-mobility separation (IMS) acquisition named ultradefinition MSE (UDMSE). Optimization and determination of the optimal peptide load on column was performed using pool sample, containing an equal amount of each 18 individual samples. The pool sample was run from 100-400 ng per run. The determined optimal concentration was 400 ng per run. Each sample had one test run and initial data processing with ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS, version 3.0.3, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) for quality assurance, followed by a run at the optimal concentration.
Peptides were trapped on an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class Trap column Symmetry C18, 5 microm particles, 180 microm x 20 mm, (Waters Corporation), followed by separation on ACQUITY UPLC M-Class reverse phase C18 column HSS T3, 1.8 microm, 75 microm x 250 mm (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, US) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using 90 min multistep concave gradient. Lock mass compound Glu-1-Fibrinopeptide B (EGVNDNEEGFFSAR) with a concentration of 100 fmol/microL was delivered by the auxiliary pump of the LC system at 500 nL/min, every 45 s. Spectra were recorded in resolution positive ion mode. Mass spectrometric settings were as previously described in detail.
4.4. LC-MS/MS Data Processing
Data was searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database containing 20,370 proteins (June 2020), with added yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (UniProt P00330) sequence. Test runs were processed using PLGS (Waters Corporation) with the following settings: (1) low energy (LE) and high energy (HE) threshold settings of 150 counts and 30 counts, respectively; (2) Precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances set to auto; (3) Search settings included one missed cleavages, carbamidomethyl C as a fixed modification, and oxidized M as a variable modification; (4) A minimum of two fragment ion matches was required per peptide identification and five fragment ion matches per protein identification, with at least one peptide match per protein identification; (5) The protein false discovery rate (FDR) was set to a 1%; (6) internal standard protein, P00330 with concentration of 25 fmol/muL. The data were post-acquisition lock mass corrected using the doubly charged monoisotopic ion of [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B. The typical range of RMS error for precursor and product ions for were +/-5 and +/-10 ppm, respectively.
Comparative proteomics analysis was carried out using Progenesis QIP version 4.1 (Nonlinear dynamics, Waters Corporation). The following settings were applied: (1) LE and HE threshold set to auto; (2) reference run-auto; (3) normalization-"normalize to all proteins"; (4) digest reagent-trypsin; (5) maximum missed cleavages-one; (6) maximum protein mass-250 kDa; (7) fixed modifications-carbamidomethyl C; (8) variable modification-oxidation M; (9) peptide tolerance-auto; (10) fragment tolerance-auto; (11) FDR < 1%; (12) Ion matching requirements as in PLGS processing; (13) Quantification based on non-conflicting peptides; (14) Grouping of similar proteins; (15) The combined target-decoy database for database search. Data were further filtrated to remove peptides with a sequence length of less than six amino acids and a score below 4. Proteins and peptides were exported in the form of a .csv output files for subsequent data analysis. The calculated FDR on the whole dataset level was 3.68%.
4.5. Quantitative Measurement of Candidate Proteins in Urine
For the quantitative measurement of the selected proteins in urine, we used the following ELISA kits: Human Nicotinamide-N-Methyltransferase (NNMT) ELISA (Cat. No.: MBS453001) with a lower limit of detection (LLD) = 0.059 ng/mL; Human Galactokinase 1 (GALK1) ELISA Kit (Cat. No.: MBS8804227) with LLD = 1.57 ng/mL; and Human Serine protease HTRA1 (HTRA1) ELISA Kit (Cat. No.: MBS902316) with LLD = 0.39 ng/mL. ELISA kits were purchased from MyBioSource.com. Samples were assayed using 100 microL undiluted urine, in duplicate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrations of NNMT, GALK1, and HTRA1 were normalized to urine creatinine to correct for variations in urinary concentration.
4.6. Data Analysis
Differentially abundant proteins were selected based on Anova <= 0.05. Statistically significant protein levels between groups were determined by the Mann-Whitney U test and corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Panther and STRING databases were used for functional annotation and enrichment analysis, respectively. STRING settings included (1) full STRING network; (2) evidence setting; (3) all active interaction sources; (4) medium confidence score; and (5) max number of interactors to show, for the 1st shell-none/query proteins only, and for the 2nd shell-none. The tissue specificity and distribution of the selected proteins in the normal bladder tissue and in cancer was evaluated based on the mRNA expression data from Human Protein Atlas version 21.0.
Statistical analyses included: (1) Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors, and Jarque-Bera tests for data distribution; (2) Mann-Whitney U-test for two-sample comparisons; (3) Spearman's rho correlation for the correlation of the quantitative proteomics data with the patient's clinical and histopathological reports; (4) logistic regression with clinical diagnosis or cancer stage as the dependent variable and protein concentrations as independent variables; and (5) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Diagnostic performance was defined by area under the curve (AUC). A confidence level of 95% (p < 0.05) was considered significant for all performed tests. These tests were performed using XLSTAT software ver. 2022.1.2 ().
5. Conclusions
Using comparative proteomics approach in analyzing BCa tissues ranging from initial to advanced stages, we have identified pathways that are involved in BCa pathogenesis and panel of potential biomarker candidates that displayed strong correlation with the progression of the disease. We chose to validate three candidate biomarkers, NNMT, GALK1, and HTRA1, for which limited data about their relationship with BCa, based mainly on gene expression and IHC methods, was available. Validation revealed a clinically relevant correlation between tissue and urine concentrations of NNMT and GALK1 with BCa. Our study for the first time accessed the protein levels of NNMT and GALK1 in BCa patients' tissues and urine as well as reported their correlation with disease stage. The observed relationship proposes two new biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of BCa. In addition, this study opens a way to further testing and validation of more high-quality proteomics biomarkers that could ultimately add value to the clinical management of BCa.
