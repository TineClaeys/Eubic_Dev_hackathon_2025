Mind the Gap: EuBIC-MS Developers Meeting 2025 Hackathon

Previously SDRF-annotated papers were scraped to have usable annotations from the bigbio github and through the PRIDE API.
From these, through the PubmedID, all papers published before march 2024 were txt extracted containing abstract and material and methods (if open access, otherwise only abstract)

Annotationday_2101 contains folders per annotator with three batches. Each annotator has the exact same batch to set up agreeing annotation guidelines.

A draft annotation.conf has been added to this repo, it contains entities based on SDRF columns, attribute for modification type and the relationship between factor value and number of samples. This should be updated.
